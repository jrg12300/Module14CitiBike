# Module14CitiBike

Overview:

  The purpose of this module is to better understand the customer base of CitiBike in New York City. An investor is considering starting a business like CitiBike in another city, and wants to get a sense to customer behavior.

Results:

[Here is the link to my dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/jack.getman#!/vizhome/Module14Deliverable3/CitiBikeStory?publish=yes)

1) I show how many rides were given in month
2) Show the locations of the rentals
3) Show the durations of the rides. It is clear that an overwhelming majority of the rides are less than 30 minutes
4) The behavior shown in story slide 3 is shown to be consistent in customers of either gender. Also, this graph shows us that CitiBike has more male customers
5) The rides are more often rented during 7-9AM & 5-6PM on weekdays. These are likely commuters. On weekends, the hours from noon-5PM are the most popular. This heatmap also shows that people don't rent bikes when it's dark outside, which is a safe practice.
6) Regarding the heatmap, gender does not change which hours are the most popular
7) Most of the suscriber base is male.

Summary:

  The results of this dahsboard show that the majority of business is with men going to and from work. 2 additional visualizations I suggest are regarding how often each bike is used. Also, I would like to see a dashboard that shows the location of every bike on a map in real time.
